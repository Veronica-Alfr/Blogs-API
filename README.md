    <summary><h3>üêã Rodando no Docker vs Localmente</h3></summary>
  
  ## üëâ Com Docker
 
  :warning: Antes de come√ßar, seu docker-compose precisa estar na vers√£o 1.29 ou superior.


  > :information_source: Rode os servi√ßos `node` e `db` com o comando `docker-compose up -d --build`.

  - Lembre-se de parar o `mysql` se estiver usando localmente na porta padr√£o (`3306`), ou adapte, caso queria fazer uso da aplica√ß√£o em containers;

  - Esses servi√ßos ir√£o inicializar um container chamado `blogs_api` e outro chamado `blogs_api_db`;

  - A partir daqui voc√™ pode rodar o container `blogs_api` via CLI ou abri-lo no VS Code;

  > :information_source: Use o comando `docker exec -it blogs_api bash`.

  - Ele te dar√° acesso ao terminal interativo do container criado pelo compose, que est√° rodando em segundo plano.

  > :information_source: Instale as depend√™ncias [**Caso existam**] com `npm install`. (Instale dentro do container)
  
  - **:warning: Aten√ß√£o:** Caso opte por utilizar o Docker, **TODOS** os comandos dispon√≠veis no `package.json` (npm start, npm lint, ...) devem ser executados **DENTRO** do container, ou seja, no terminal que aparece ap√≥s a execu√ß√£o do comando `docker exec` citado acima. 

  - **:warning: Aten√ß√£o:** O **git** dentro do container n√£o vem configurado com suas credenciais. Ou fa√ßa os commits fora do container, ou configure as suas credenciais do git dentro do container.

  - **:warning: Aten√ß√£o:** N√£o rode o comando npm audit fix! Ele atualiza v√°rias depend√™ncias do projeto que podem gerar conflitos.

  - ‚ú® **Dica:** A extens√£o `Remote - Containers` √© indicada para que voc√™ possa desenvolver sua aplica√ß√£o no container Docker direto no VS Code, como voc√™ faz com seus arquivos locais.

  <br />
  
  ## üëâ Sem Docker

  > :information_source: Instale as depend√™ncias [**Caso existam**] com `npm install`
  
  - **:warning: Aten√ß√£o:** N√£o rode o comando npm audit fix! Ele atualiza v√°rias depend√™ncias do projeto que podem gerar conflitos.

  - **‚ú® Dica:** Para rodar o projeto desta forma, obrigatoriamente voc√™ deve ter o `node` instalado em seu computador.
  - **‚ú® Dica:** O avaliador espera que a vers√£o do `node` utilizada seja a 16.

      is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
      annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an

      owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf

      grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
      irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

      that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
      of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
      submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
      Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
      patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
      for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution.

      You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
      in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
      provided that You meet the following conditions:

      You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
      this License; and
      You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
      changed the files; and
      You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
      all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form
      of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
      Derivative Works; and
      If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
      Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
      attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
      that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
      following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
      Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
      with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
      Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
      the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
      License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
      You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
      provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
      modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
      additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
      distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
      provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
      with the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions.

      Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
      for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
      conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

      any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
      such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks.

      This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
      service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
      reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

      Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the
      Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
      including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
      NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
      solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
      redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
      permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability.

      In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
      contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
      and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
      or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
      out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
      damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
      any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
      been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

      While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
      offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
      other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
      in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
      sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
      agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
      accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
